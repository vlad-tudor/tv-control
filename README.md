## Steps

1. ensure node and npm/other packet managers are installed
2. clone repository,
3. cd <project_folder>
4. npm install
5. npm start, visit localhost:3000

notes:
cons:

- Not all requiremenst have been implemented.
- I haven't added a bunch of the input types, not all input types are created equal and I haven't even attempted the grid, because it would take me more than a day.

pros:

- I tried to develop as much framework as I could around existing code
- Where I've implemented a feature, I've made it reusable (like the validation pattern)

I'd like to hear your thoughts :)
